    <p><b>So who am I?</b>, I guess you know my name. In case you dont, My name is Syed Abbas Aman, you can consider Aman for the mean time until we connect and you give me nicknames. As every human does, I was also born to my parents Syed Abbas and S. Vijaya, but whats different is that I am born on 3rd of Januray 2002, which few people might not have common with me. I was born into a middle class family structured mostly on old school traditional principles of Hardwork, Unity, Respect to each other and considerable amount of fun. I live in a considerablly big town in Andhra Pradesh, called Chittoor. I have grown up in a really strict atmosphere where I rarely got to have friends to go out with. I have grown up playing in a closed room, but when I got to have a chance to socialize I have done a great deal of crazy things. I have had a hate towards cricket till I was 9. But after the 2011 world cup I have turned out to be a cricket wizard. Since then I have been watching, playing and thinking cricket all the time. As my father, my aunts and all others around me are teachers I was forced to be good a studies. So I am good at studies, and I am also good at communication. I like watching movies and really like going to theaters.</p>
